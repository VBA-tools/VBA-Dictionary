# VBA-Dictionary

VBA-Dictionary is a drop-in replacement for the useful and powerful `Scripting.Dictionary` so that it can be used with both Mac and Windows. This is based on Tim Hall's source code. The only difference is I fixed [a bug](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Dictionary/pull/29) in his original source code. The bug prevented you from iterating through the collection object like you do with the standard one.
